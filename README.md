i know and evrybody knows you should get rid of vibe coding.

well glad you asked!

so with Treat gpt you could get rid of vibe coding, baicically Treat Gpt gives you a Treat evry time you do a comit to github and each comit = 5 questions

(currently this is my first comit for the project its baicically the chating futer and the github api)
