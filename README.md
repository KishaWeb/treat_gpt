so with Treat gpt you could get rid of vibe coding, basically Treat Gpt gives you a Treat every time you do a comit to github and each commit = 5 questions

## Installation

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/KishaWeb/treat_gpt.git
  pip install rich rich-click requests toml
  cd petfetch
  chmod +x script/main.py
  sudo ln -s script/main.py /usr/local/bin/treat_gpt
